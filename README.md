# HBB Gene Evolutionary Analysis

This project investigates the evolutionary conservation of the **Hemoglobin Beta (HBB)** gene across six species using bioinformatics techniques.

## ðŸ”¬ Objectives

- Retrieve and align HBB protein sequences from 6 species.
- Perform pairwise and multiple sequence alignments.
- Generate a sequence logo to visualize conserved amino acids.
- Construct a phylogenetic tree to analyze evolutionary relationships.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Report.pdf` â€” Final project report
- `MSA.fa` â€” Multiple sequence alignment file
- `sequence_logo.png` â€” Visual output showing conserved residues
- `phylogenetic_tree.png` â€” Evolutionary tree generated from MSA

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- NCBI BLAST
- Clustal Omega
- Skylign / WebLogo
- MEGA X
- Git & GitHub

## ðŸ“Š Summary

- Highest similarity: Human â†” Chimpanzee
- Lowest similarity: Human â†” Zebrafish
- Several highly conserved residues identified across all species
- Tree topology matches known vertebrate evolution
